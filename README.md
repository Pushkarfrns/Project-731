# Analyzing the Factors affecting Earth's Climate Change
This is the repository for our EECS-731 (Introduction to Data-Science) course
project.

# TO-DO Tasks
Following is a list of tasks which we should start working on. Please feel free
to update the list. Also, if you want to take up a task, just put your initial
in front of it so that we may not duplicate our efforts.

## Stage-1
  - Collect the datasets that we want to analyze in this project (W)
  - Document each dataset (what are the features available and what each feature
    represents)
  - Perform faceting on each dataset; understand what information we can glean
    from each one
    - Temperature (W)
    - CO2 Emission
    - Fossil Fuels
    - Ozone Layer
    - Natural Catastrophes
    - ...

## Stage-2
  - Perform feature engineering
  - Identify a common index along which we can unite the datasets. Create a new
    dataset containing merged data from each individual dataset

## Stage-3
  - Perform regression on the merged dataset to predict the decision (e.g.,
    Earth's temperature for a particular year)
